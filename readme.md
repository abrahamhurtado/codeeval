# CodeEval

My solutions to CodeEval's challenges. Written mostly on JavaScript and sometimes in Java. Will try to add solutions in more languages as I learn them!

This should be a reference for CSIPRO's Coding Wednesday events.

PR from CSIPRO members would be nice \o/

## Testing the JS solutions
Should work fine in NodeJS >= 5.x.x, I am using AVA as a test runner.
```
git clone [this repo]
npm install
npm test
```
